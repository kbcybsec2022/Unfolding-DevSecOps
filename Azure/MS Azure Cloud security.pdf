Principles - are the building blocks with which you can form a solid foundation for your Azure security:
==============================================================================================================================================================
Principle 1: Understanding and logically grouping all resources avoids the growth of an unrecognized attack surface.
Principle 2: Isolation of resources helps reduce the “blast radius” of a cyber-attack.
Principle 3: Backups can keep business-critical resources online 24/7 in the event of a disaster.
Principle 4: Defining appropriate user permissions and auditing them can limit an attacker’s access and persistence.
Principle 5: Comprehensive and continuous log collection creates a reliable and detailed audit trail for both resource performance and control plane activities.
Principle 6: Effective guardrails help establish a minimum security and compliance configuration, without disrupting development activities. 
Principle 7: Continuous evaluation of existing practices can highlight deficiencies in your security and inform design improvements.
Principle 8: Continuously collecting relevant telemetry and implementing suitably prioritized alerts support an effective detection and response capability.
Principle 9: Collaboration between cloud engineers and security analysts, and the use of appropriate tools, help form a capable and proactive investigation team.
